# A 24 Hours Chess game

#### This is a fun side project where 2 users can play chess game for 24 hours. They can make a move and then continue only when the other person has made a move. The rules are just like a normal chess game but it's just that time limit has been increased.

Timelog:

- 23rd March: Got the idea while talking to nikhil to build something.

- 24th March: Planning, environment setup and initial designs and brainstorming.

- 29th March: Made valid_move() function and redesigned the data structure for chess board and chess sqaure.
